# ✈️ British Airways Predictive Booking Model

This project was completed as part of the Forage Data Science Virtual Experience with British Airways. The goal was to use predictive modeling to identify potential customers likely to complete a booking **before** their travel.

## 📌 Task Overview
- Prepare and clean customer booking data
- Train a machine learning model (Random Forest)
- Evaluate its performance
- Identify the most predictive features
- Summarize findings in a single slide for stakeholders

## 📂 Repository Structure
- `BA_Booking_Model.py`: Complete Python script with model training and visualization
- `BA_Booking_Model_Summary.pptx`: One-slide executive summary with insights and recommendations
- `top_features_chart.png`: Feature importance visualization
- `data/customer_booking.csv`: Provided dataset (encoded version)
- `notebooks/`: Script folder for future Jupyter/Colab integration

## 📈 Model Summary
- **Accuracy**: 85.6%
- **Top Features**:
  - Purchase Lead Time
  - Route
  - Flight Hour
  - Length of Stay
  - Booking Origin
- **Key Insight**: Most bookings are influenced by time of purchase and route. Targeted marketing can increase conversions.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python
- pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
